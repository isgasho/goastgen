### Go AST Generator
All this does is create the AST output recursively from a directory

### Installation
``` sh
go get github.com/serafdev/goastgen
```

### Usage
Go to whatever folder where your gocode resides, then run goastgen

Currently it uses the relative path, I will add soon a `-path` flag to make this nicer
